# PyPSA-SPICE-Vis: visualisation tool for PyPSA-SPICE model builder

PyPSA-SPICE-Vis is an open-source tool designed to simplify the visualisation and comparison of outputs generated by the PyPSA-SPICE model builder. It allows users to view and compare charts from post-analysis of multiple scenarios directly within a single webpage. As PyPSA-SPICE-Vis is built to work with the PyPSA-SPICE model builder, having the PyPSA-SPICE model builder is a prerequisite for using this tool.

## How to use it

### Run streamlit app

The pypsa-spice-vis folder and its files should be inside the PyPSA-SPICE repository by default. The output folder that PyPSA-SPICE-Vis will access is defined from the `output_scenario_name` in `pypsa-spice/config.yaml`.

You can run streamlit app with the command below:

=== "Current path in `pypsa-spice/`"

    ```bash
    streamlit run pypsa-spice-vis/main.py
    ```

=== "Current path in `pypsa-spice/pypsa-spice-vis/`"

    ```bash
    streamlit run main.py
    ```

After running, you will be able to see a local web link/url in the terminal. Simply open the link/url in your browser and you will be able to see the visualisations.

## What charts are displayed in the tool by default

The available charts and sections are listed in [List of charts and sections](../visualisation-tool/vis-sections-and-charts.md) which you will be able to see all of them in the browser if your model include all sectors (power+industry+transport).

## Deploy your visualisation results to the web

You can review the visualisation in the localhost or deploy them into the webpage. More details are described in [deployment](../visualisation-tool/deployment.md)
