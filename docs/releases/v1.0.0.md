## v1.0.0 (2026-01-DD)

This is the first tagged release of PyPSA-SPICE :partying_face: and represents a complete, fully functional implementation of the model. It establishes the baseline for all future development and includes the core model formulation, execution and post-analysis workflows, the scenario configuration system, and comprehensive documentation.

### Fixed

- Resolve the filtering issue with regional filters when adding load for non-electricity ones and missing interconnection ([:material-source-pull:51](https://github.com/agoenergy/pypsa-spice/pull/51) by @nhlong2701)

### Changed

- Update PyPSA version to `1.0.6` and refactor code to adapt to new changes ([:material-source-pull:54](https://github.com/agoenergy/pypsa-spice/pull/54) by @nhlong2701)
- Update `scenario_config` workflow and template structure ([:material-source-pull:58](https://github.com/agoenergy/pypsa-spice/pull/58) by @RichChang963)
- Add maximum power generation constraint ([:material-source-pull:59](https://github.com/agoenergy/pypsa-spice/pull/5958) by @RichChang963)

### Notes

- **PyPSA version upgrade:** We have upgraded PyPSA to `v1.0.6` and encourage users to upgrade their environments (using `conda env update -f envs/environment.yaml --prune`) to ensure full compatibility with the latest features and improvements.
- **Simplification of initial project setup:** The `build_skeleton` rule now automatically generates a `scenario_config.yaml` file, simplifying initial project setup.
- **New parameter in custom constraints:** A new boolean control field, `active`, has been introduced for defining custom constraints within `scenario_config.yaml`. Users should update their configuration format as described in the [documentation](https://agoenergy.github.io/pypsa-spice/getting-started/input-data/model-builder-configuration/#scenario_configyaml-custom-constraints) to maintain compatibility and avoid configuration errors.
